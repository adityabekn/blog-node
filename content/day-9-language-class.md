> Hello Guys, my name is Aditya Bekti Nugroho. I am currently following internship program from SEA-TVET and this blog will report my journey during the following program.

After we learn about that, we got the test especially the English exam to measure how proficient i am in English. This test is computer-based exam so we use mac from TAU iLab to take an exam.

Then after we complete the exam, we must wait the score to appear and then we must fill all the question in library. It took so many time because it has 300 question, and afterward we can see the score from the computer-based exam.

It was very brain-tired for me, and it was good day because i learn so much about basic Tagalog so we can use to communicate later. And the English exam is pretty hard, even though is difficult but i was satisfied.

*Thatâ€™s all folks, See you later.*
