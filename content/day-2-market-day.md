> Hello Guys, my name is Aditya Bekti Nugroho. I am currently following internship program from SEA-TVET and this blog will report my journey during the following program.

**February 7, 2019**. This early morning at 7 a.m, my friends and i going to market to buy some vegetables and some stuff for our kitchen and the buddies is coming with us. We go to here using **JEEPNEY** only 10pesos for the trip. **CAMILING PUBLIC MARKET** is the name of the market, and only this market can provide us cheap and hygiene vegetables and meat.

Actually this market very close to the mall, but people seems prefer to market for their needs. Inside the market, is very clean and big. I am impressed by this, because in Indonesia the market doesn’t looks good.

I am buying some vegetable like kale, spinach, onion, garlic, and etc. I can’t bargain because they already set the price very low and indeed i can’t tagalog.
