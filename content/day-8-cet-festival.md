The parade is going around all area in Tarlac Agricultural University, and some village near University.

In Parade some people use the traditional costume from Phillipines, and i amazed by the beauty of it and actually it is handmade by the student college here from all organic material like leaf, root, sap, and recycled stuff.

We jog and walk around the forest and village in parade, and i took the photo with Sir Joven, Sir Ruben, Ma’am Sheila and some student. All along the walk we are singing and yell-yell across the road.
