> Hello Guys, my name is Aditya Bekti Nugroho. I am currently following internship program from SEA-TVET and this blog will report my journey during the following program.

**February 10, 2019**. My friends and i go to city park in Camiling. The city park is near to public market, so after we arrive at the market we walk from there to city park to try some street food from Phillipines. My first impression for street for here is why everything using skewers, even though the food is already fried from the hot oil, the seller still using skewer for the food. Maybe it is more portable to eat, and then i tried some Kwek-Kwek and Fishball with some gravy sauce.

At first try i am very afraid if this doesn’t taste good, but actually it taste delicious or Masarap. We look another store to see what they sell, and we found some chicken satay and beef. I try some of this, and it taste good and cheap. When i ask them how much this cost? and it actually only 10pesos.

From all the meat we found, i must be careful about the pork because i can’t eat that and forbidden for moeslem. And the buddies tell me to ask the seller “Baboy?” which is mean pork or pig.

The buddies tell us to try some strange food, which is “Balut” it has smell fishy and it doesn’t look good. But we try it anyway, and after we open the egg shell it has child duck and i was like “What?” and i try eat that and the taste not so bad, it just like an egg.

*That’s all folks, See you later.*
