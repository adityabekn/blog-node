> Hello Guys, my name is Aditya Bekti Nugroho. I am currently following internship program from SEA-TVET and this blog will report my journey during the following program.

**February 5, 2019**. My partner from Sebelas Maret University, Arruya Hiyarrani and i took flight from Soekarno-Hatta Airport to Ninoy Aquino International Airport. At 5 a.m, we already at the airport to make sure we don’t miss the flight.

Our flight must transit to Kuala Lumpur International Airport, so thats why it took 6 hours flight.

My Friends and i arrive at Ninoy Aquino International Airport at 2 pm, and we were greeted Mr. Justin at the airport. He already waited us in front of the arrival gate, and will accompany us to Tarlac Agricultural Univesity using official car.

Before we go, we had our lunch at Jollibee near Quezon City. When we were having lunch, he told us our trip would take approximately 5 hour from Manila to Tarlac. And after that we arrived at Tarlac Agricultural University FTC at 7 p.m and it was a very long journey and he told us to rest immediately.

**February 6, 2019**. In the morning i don’t have any food for my breakfast and then someone knock on my door. And 3 people were already standing in front my door after that they introduced themselves that they are the buddies who will accompany me.

After that they were guided us to exploring the university, and of course i am very hungry i don’t hear all the words they told me. And i ask them where i can get my breakfast, and then we go to the canteen.

*That’s all folks, See you later.*
