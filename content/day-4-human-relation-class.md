> Hello Guys, my name is Aditya Bekti Nugroho. I am currently following internship program from SEA-TVET and this blog will report my journey during the following program.

**February 9, 2019**. I am attending a class about “Human relation” with Ma’am Cristine. The class is about how important communication to human. We must blend in with community and talk to each other, and she is tell us about how bad if we not socialize and anti-social.

They are performing drama about “Human Characteristic”, every dialog have deep meaning and i enjoy it so much. We as human must know that every human have different character and attitude, and thats why “Human Relation” skills are necessary for us as human and community.

After that we blend in with filipino student and communicate with them asking something, chatting, and others topic. I have good times with them actually, and i share our opinion about Phillipines, about the food, the environment, and the people. I just answer it with full explanation and they are listening every single word i say. And it was a good class by Ma’am Cristine, i learn so much about “Human Relation” and know more about Phillipines especially the food and street food.

*That’s all folks, See you later.*
